Mailbox Log Archiver for Skype is a Skype plugin that allows storing Skype logs in any mailbox that supports IMAP protocol (for example, GMail). The advantages of this are:

    * Global search across all your Skype logs and email (if your email client supports it).
    * Central storage for logs (when using multiple machines)
    * No need to store the logs locally, which could be less secure than a mailbox in some environments.

The logs are stored in a separate mailbox folder called "Skype logs" a lot like GTalk logs in GMail.
